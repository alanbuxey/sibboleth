<p>Welcome to the Sibboleth API</p>

<p>Sibboleth can be used to do shibboleth authentication from a
desktop application instead of, how it was designed to be used, via
redirects and a web browser.</p>
<p>It was written originally in Python, but it now has got a Java
wrapper around it that enables access to its functionality within a Java
application (via Jython).</p>
<p>For more information, please visit the projects homepage on
