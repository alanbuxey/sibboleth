sibboleth
=========

**sibboleth** is a [Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/) client library for use from a desktop. 

And, no, the name **sibboleth** is not a typo. We did that on purpose...

*Shibboleth*:

> A shibboleth (pronounced /ˈʃɪbəlɛθ/[1] or /ˈʃɪbələθ/[2]) is any distinguishing practice that is indicative of one's social or regional origin. It usually refers to features of language, and particularly to a word whose pronunciation identifies its speaker as being a member or not a member of a particular group.

Since **sibboleth** talks *Shibboleth* not via a web-browser but via a desktop application, we figured that might just be appropriate :-)

Originally it was written in Python, but it also provides a Java wrapper to enable its functionality from Java applications (via [Jython](http://jython.org)).
